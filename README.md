# Traffic-sign-detection-using
condensed our dataset to present a versus network that compares which type of traffic sign will perform better using the same CNN model and measuring the performance on both.. This included speed limit  vs regular traffic signs.  We included 1,800 80 mph speed limit images and 1,800 70 mph speed limit images. Then compared those results with 1,800 yield sign images and 1,800 pass by on left images.
